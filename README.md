Game Proposal and Storyboard
This game proposal outlines the idea of the game, the movements, objects and the goal of the game. It also shows the storyboard of how the interactions of the game and how it should be when players open the application, going through each inputs, buttons, and inforamtion presented on the screen.

Logical Entity Relationship Diagram
The entity relationship diagram shows the structure of the game's database, the entities such as Player, Game, Enemy, Inventory, and more, with their relationship and how it connects. it is a blueprint for organizing the data in the database for the game to run consistenly

CRUD Table
I have made a CRUD Table which shows the Create, Read, Update, and Delete for each entity in the game database, it shows the different user actions, such as registering a new player, joining a game, sending a message, This table is great for having an understanding on how the application should work in order to handle the correct operations.

DDL SQL Create Tables
I have implemented the DDL SQL create table by defining the database schema for the game. which includes creating table for each entity sush as Player, Game, Inventory, Map, Tile, etc. and adding their datatypes, primary keys and foreign keys.

C#.net Prototype
This application prototype is created to show the functionality and the connection between the sql database and the application. the three main screens login and registration, gameplay and adminstration should be connected and with a correspoding data access object for each window that would test the connection to the database.
